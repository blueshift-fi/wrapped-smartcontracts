  6. **Expiration of NonCommercial Limitations**. The NonCommercial restrictions and limitations will expire for each Release of the Licensed Materials three years after the date of such Release.

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material, including for purposes of Section 2(b); and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 2(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

Nothing in this Section 3 will be read to grant to You cryptocurrency, cryptographically restricted tokens, or other digital assets.

**Section 4 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.**

a. **Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.**

To the extent a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.**

c. **To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for more than USD$1.00.**

d. The disclaimer of warranties and limitations of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy.

**Section 5 – Term and Termination.**

1. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically and immediately.
2. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 5(a), it reinstates:
  1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, if such violation is able to be cured, provided it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation, and the violation does not concern any NonCommercial restriction or limitation; or
  2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 5(b) does not affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public License.

1. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.
2. Sections 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8survive termination of this Public License.

**Section 7 – Interpretation.**

1. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.
2. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.
3. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.
4. You may not assign any of Your rights or obligations under this Public License, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of the Licensor, except in connection with a bona fide merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially Your assets
5. The terms 'include' and 'including' will be deemed to be immediately followed by the phrase "without limitation." The word "will" expresses an obligation of a party equivalent to "shall" when a party is the subject of the sentence. The word "or" has an inclusive meaning, equivalent to "or" except where the context requires (e.g., "either (x) or (y)"). This Public License will not be construed in favor of or against any party by reason of the extent to which any party participated in the preparation of this Public License. Should any terms of this Public License be determined to be otherwise void or unenforceable by any arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction, such terms will be deemed amended to achieve as nearly as possible the same effect as the original terms and the remainder of this Public License will remain in full force and effect. The parties hereto confirm that they have requested that this Public License be drafted in English. Les parties ont exigé que le présent contrat et tous les documents connexes soient rédigés en anglais.
